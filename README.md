# 🎓 Student Analyzer - Migration Portfolio Project

This project simulates a real-world data analysis task for a school or academic institution. It helps school administrators extract actionable insights from students' scores using Python and built-in statistical tools.

---

## 💼 Purpose

This project is part of my professional portfolio to showcase my skills in:
- Data processing with Python
- Statistical computation (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.)
- Modular code design and test-driven development
- Exporting processed data for reporting

---

## 🔍 Features

- Load student scores from a CSV file
- Calculate average, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation
- Identify top-performing students
- Export results to a clean CSV report
- Unit testing for core statistical functions
- Step-by-step development structure
- Final version ready for production or extension
